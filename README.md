# Text-To-Speech
This Python Text-to-Speech (TTS) application uses tkinter for a user-friendly interface and pyttsx3 for speech synthesis. Users can input text to be spoken aloud, enhanced by an animated microphone that indicates when speech is active. The app remains responsive, allowing for seamless interaction during playback.
